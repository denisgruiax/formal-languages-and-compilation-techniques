# Exercises from the Formal-Languages and Compilation Techniques laboratory.

## Warning. ⚠️
**I do not guarantee the correctness of the code!** ❌

The code is difficult to understand and should be broken into several groups and the project restructured into levels.

The code also violates several design principles that should be fixed. I will list a few things below:

- ❌ it's not open closed
- ❌ the code is hard to understand
- ❌ it is difficult to add new code
- ❌ the code has dependencies that it shouldn't have
- ❌ memory management could be done better
- ❌ the functions could be better defined and implemented
- ❌ and so on so forth...

## About the project. 🪴
### Purpose. 🎯
The purpose of this programs is to test the ability to solve problems that consist in the basics of working with: 📚
```sh
1. Introduction to formal languages and compiler techniques. Regular expressions.
2. Representation of lexical atoms through transition diagrams.
3. Implementation of the lexical analyzer.
4. Implementation of the parser.
5. Table of symbols. Domain analysis.
6. Analysis of types.
7. Virtual machine: structure, execution, instructions.
8. Code generation.
9. Code optimization.
```

### Built With. ⚒️
The programs can be build with C or C++ compilers.

## Getting Started. 🚀
### System requirements ✅
- Operating System: MacOS, Windows, Linux(Ubuntu for example), Windows Subsystem for Linux. (WSL)
- Programming Language: C
- Code Editor: Visual Studio Code 

I used WSL as operating system, VSCode as code editor and to compile the code i made use of gcc compiler.

### Installation. 🪜
1. Install c/c++
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install build-essential
   ```

2. Compile from command line
   ```sh
   gcc -Wall app.c -o app
   ```
   
3. VSCode C/C++ extesion pack
   ```sh
   (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools-extension-pack)
   ```
   
4. Configure VSCode to run and debug C/C++ programs inside VSCode under WSL.
   ```sh
   https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-wsl
   ```
